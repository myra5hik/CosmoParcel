# CosmoParcel ðŸš€

**CosmoParcel is a cosmos gravity simulation game** built within fortnight as an educational project to participate in the WWDC23 Student Challenge.

The game aims to help players develop their visual intuition about how gravity works. The player's mission is to deliver cargo to human colonies on different planets. The game simulates real-world gravitational interactions of celestial bodies, following Newton's laws, including when they are set to orbit another object.

Time manipulation aids gameplay, with speed indicators provided to the user. Players can set the spaceship's liftoff trajectory, but must consider the gravitational pulls of cosmic bodies that will influence the spacecraft's path after liftoff. This interactive experience fosters a deeper understanding of gravitational laws.

## Technologies Used
- SpriteKit
- GameplayKit
- ECS architecture

## Running the Code

To run CosmoParcel:

1. Airdrop the `.swiftpm` bundle to an iPad.
2. Open with the Playgrounds app on the device. (Note: Using Playgrounds was a requirement for the WWDC challenge.)
3. During the build process, the Playgrounds app will display a blank screen. The build may take around 10 sec, due to the use of sprite atlases.
4. The game should launch then.

_Running on the simulator may result in unusual physics behaviors. If that happens, simply relaunch the level. Running the game on a device should provide the expected experience without issues._
