        Welcome to the Earth and Moon level!

        Your goal in this level is to deliver cargo to a human colony located on the Moon.

        It is an easy level designed to help players build their visual intuition about how gravity works. The effects of gravity will have a significant impact on spacecraft's trajectory.

        This level replicates the real scales of the Earth and Moon, with a few exceptions:
         ‚Ä¢ The cosmic bodies are 5x larger for better visibility on the map.
         ‚Ä¢ The Moon's mass has been increased 10x times to make gameplay easier.

        T minus thirty!
